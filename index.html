<h1><strong>Seven Seas</strong></h1>
<hr>
	<h2>Sea</h2>
		<p><i>The word Sea can be defined as "The expanse of salt water that covers most of the earth's surface and surrounds its landmasses"</i></p>
	<br>
		<p>The seas of the world are not known by many, as people are said to be able to name only five of the seas from memory. This is a common mistake as the information is not taught in grade school and is not a nessecary piece of knowledge everyone needs to know. But what could be more exciting than the world and the seas that connect the continents!</p>
